          COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) <br />
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
          parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's
          consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
          what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
          children's privacy and safety online.
          <br />
          We do not specifically market to children under 13.
